# The message includes a list of the offsets for each jump. Jumps are relative: -1 moves to the previous instruction, and 2 skips the next one. Start at the first instruction in the list. The goal is to follow the jumps until one leads outside the list.
# After each jump, the offset of that instruction increases by 1, but if the offset was three or more, instead decrease it by 1.
# How many steps does it take to reach the exit?
